<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am semi retired.  I do IVR programming in Java and vxml and some Python.</p>

<p>I'm working on a Masters/PhD in AstroPhysics, which is kicking my keaster because I took algebra
  50 years ago.  It's great fun though going back and doing algebra, College English, Probability,
Calculus and Chemistry.</p>
